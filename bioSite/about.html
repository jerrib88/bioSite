    <p>Kim was born in Iowa City, Iowa, and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska with her only sibling Cynthia (Cyn for short). She attended Southeast High School and spent time at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln before having her first child at 26 and the second at 30. She is a Bridal Consultant at a small bridal shop and helps brides find the dress of their dreams. Taking appointments and scheduling dress pickup is another important piece of her job and managing the businessâ€™s social media profile. </p>

    <p>Some of her favorite things include Mexican food, especially from Lil Burro. Colors on the favorite list include green, purple, red, and white. A few memories come up as favorites, the list includes the birth of both her girls and her snorkeling adventure on her honeymoon in Kauai, and pedicures for self-care whenever she needs a break from everyday life. </p>
