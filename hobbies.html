        <p>The list of hobbies goes on for Kim. Starting at number one with lounging in the pool during hot summers and going on walks. She has read what seems like thousands of books in her lifetime and has recently gotten into doing her nails at home. When she has downtime and gets to watch some of her favorite shows and movies, often a reality show or a scary movie. When she is enjoying her shows she often ends up playing with the pup known as Josie Jo who is always attached to her hip. She dreams of visiting the Maldives and Bora Bora being a tropical weather fiend but for now will settle by the pool in the Nebraska summer sun. </p>
